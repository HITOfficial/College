# Each undirected, consistent and acyclic graph G = (V, E) can be treated as a tree. The root of this tree can be any vertex v âˆˆ V. Write a best root (L) function that
# takes an undirected, connected and acyclic graph G (represented as a neighborhood list) and
# chooses such its top, by the height of the rooted at this vertex, which would be cultivating it. If several vertices have the correct conditions, a function can have any of the
# niche. We define a tree tree as an edge solution from the root to the farthest leaf. Justification
# Correctness of the proposed algorithm and estimate its computational complexity.
