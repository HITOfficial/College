# A list of I closed intervals is given [a1, b1], [a2, b2],. . . , [an, bn]. Break function intervals (

# one of the selected periods selected from among the selected ones. Function
# she should be ours as soon as possible.
# The intervals are represented as pairs. The function is the appropriate list of numbers in which the request is confirmed
# element to the length of the longest interval that is searched for, built of the prime and elements

# complexity:
# - time O(K*N^2) creating previously element connections N^2, finding longest connection O(N)
